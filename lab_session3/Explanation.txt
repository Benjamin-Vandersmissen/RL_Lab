The search space has quadrupled in size 4x4 (=16) to 8x8 (=64), this means, we need to increase the total steps as well, because otherwise, most of the runs will never reach the goal. Increasing the total steps, means we need to decrease the decay rate, because otherwise the epsilon will be too low before we reach the goal, which means the algorithm won't explore anymore. In this case, the actions are non-deterministic, so it's prudent to set the min_epsilon a little bit higher, avoiding false positives. Because it is non-deterministic, we also increase the number of episodes, to have a better view of the situation.
